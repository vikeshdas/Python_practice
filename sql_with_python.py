"""
SQL lite

- SQLite does not require a separate server process or external dependencies to function

- No installation or configuration is neededâ€”just link the library to your application.

-he database runs inside your application, not as a separate service.

-There is no client-server architecture unlike MySQL

-The database is stored as a single file (.db or .sqlite) on disk, making it easy to bundle with an app.

-Unlike traditional databases (e.g., MySQL, SQL Server), SQLite does not require a database server.
